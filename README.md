This project focuses on predicting the closing stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using historical data collected from Yahoo Finance. The dataset spans from January 2020 to December 2023 and includes features such as Open, High, Low, and Volume, with the Close price used as the target variable. Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy were used for preprocessing, while yFinance was applied to fetch stock data. A Linear Regression model was trained and evaluated using RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error to measure accuracy. Visualizations of actual versus predicted prices were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, with results saved as output files for reporting. The project generates two key outputs: metrics.txt, which contains the evaluation scores, and prediction_plot.png, which shows the comparison between actual and predicted stock prices.
